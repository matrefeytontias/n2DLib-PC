This is technically not PC-specific. It is built on top of SDL2, so strictly speaking every platform that supports SDL2 should also support n2DLib. Linking with SDL2 doesn't require anything other than the typical linking options, and I swear I'll build binaries of this eventually maybe one day. (y)
